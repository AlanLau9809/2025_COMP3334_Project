### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanLau9809/COMP3334_Project.git
cd COMP3334_Project
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Setup
1. Start XAMPP and run MySQL server
2. import online_storage.sql


## Running the Application
### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
python run.py
```

### 2. Access Application
Open in browser:
[http://localhost:5000/login](http://localhost:5000/login)


## Admin Account Setup
For security reasons, the registration interface does not provide an option to create admin accounts.
To create an administrator user:
### Method 1: Database Modification
1. Register a regular user through the web interface
2. Using phpMyAdmin client:
```sql
UPDATE user SET is_admin = 1 WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

### Method 2: Use Pre-configured Admin (Recommended for Initial Setup)
A default admin account is included in the database schema:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin
- Security Note:
    - Change the password immediately after first login
    - This account should only be used for initial setup
